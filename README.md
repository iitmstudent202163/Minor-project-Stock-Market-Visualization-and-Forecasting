# Minor-project-Stock-Market-Visualization-and-Forecasting
## Project Title: 
Stock Market Visualization and Forecasting using LSTM and Streamlit.
## Description: 
Developed a predictive model for stock market trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm and a web application for visualization using Streamlit.
The "Stock Market Visualization and Forecasting" project is a data science project aimed at creating a predictive model for stock market trends. The model uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, which is a type of Recurrent Neural Network, to analyze historical stock market data and make predictions about future trends. The project also includes the development of an interactive web application using Streamlit, which allows users to visualize the stock market data and the predictions generated by the LSTM model. This project provides a comprehensive solution for stock market analysis and forecasting, offering insights and predictions to investors and traders.
## Key Responsibilities:
1. Collected and preprocessed historical stock market data.
2. Trained and evaluated the LSTM model for stock market forecasting.
3. Built an interactive web application using Streamlit for data visualization and prediction.
4. Conducted analysis and interpretive work on the model's results to validate its accuracy and reliability.
## Key Skills Utilized: 
Python, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Streamlit, Data Preprocessing, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling.
## Impact: 
Created a comprehensive solution for stock market analysis and forecasting, providing insights and predictions to investors and traders.
